I always like going for cold opens for my diary entries...

This new job is making me look back on my day, much like I used to do with journalling. It's gotten me back into this habit of recalling my day! 
Something that’s been on my mind, is my embarrassing moment yesterday where I left a silly little note during end of day thing, saying that I had eaten and drank coke/oreo falvoured oreo/coke. Well, we literally did and we did it with one of the staff that works at the school. Chantelle (I think) was really mad about this, sent me an email not to do it again and that the school will see this. I thought it was funny lol. But I also left her or read, which I should probably change, but I also don't really like the bossy attitude, feels like I'm in school again.. The smart thing is to reply back and apologise, but I couldn't care any less, sorry!! I just want to make people smile.

## What do I live for? 
Anthony, the guy I shadowed today, reminded me of what I wanted to be when I was younger, to help people. He does exactly that, and he isn’t afraid to do it either even if there are consequences. He puts others before himself. The admin at my work probably hate him for keeping things too adhoc and not creating and/or finalising tickets and what not because it's a "bad look" data wise, but he actually does get the job done with a smile nonetheless and I respect it. He only cares for making a good impact on the school, the way he knows and the way he wants to. It’s really refreshing. I really do want to be like that. 

Alsoooooo making myself busy has made me value my time more. Me working 4 days a week has made me put my thinking cap on, and it helps me realise what needs to be done and I don't just leave it for later. I remember during my years at Cadets, the leader there (Michael Barr, I think?) said "To be productive is to keep yourself busy. There are people out there doing a lot and they still somehow get things done and at a reasonable level. It's because they don't waste time." This is not word for word, but this saying has stuck with me ever since he said it. He had the answer to my question I had been asking myself for years, what is the secret to being a good worker? I feel like maybe I took it too literally and made myself too busy to even think, that's a story for another time. 
Anyways, because I'm so busy, I feel like gym is slowly becoming something I don’t want to do unfortunately. Feels like a weekend task, and my weekends are slowly becoming more and more busy as I start to pick up more things. Maybe I should reconsider what I want to do for fun? Let's have a looksie;
