Merry Christmas! 

I'm not particularly fond of catching up with extended family during Chistmas, not that I hate them or anything but it's that whole song and dance of catching up and getting asked what you're up to and not really having anything that interesting to share. Same old me, just another year older... It's exhausting having to bring something to the table and having a lot of expectations dangled above your head, and I don't particularly like socialising either. Well anyways, we do the yearly conversations, eat some nice food and open presents, but this time I joined in for some boardgames which seems to be a yearly staple that I always somehow miss (sometimes intentionally or coincidentally).
