# I eventually plan on hosting images on the website, but it takes too much space and I haven't figured out a solution for downsizing. That's a job for another day! For now, hosting on other websites seems to be the play. Efficient, cheap, easy and simple. I just looks bad.

# Short story
Today I went out to explore and take photos, and randomly stumbled upon a milk crate and stole it lol

## Long story
I was looking for a container for the back of my lekker bike, something that is durable and light weight, essentially something that I can put things in that can't fit in my bag when I'm biking. I figured a milk crate would be perfect for this. So, obviously first thing I do is look online for milk crate prices. 

Prices are so expensive for something so simple, and it looks like they're normally bought in bulk so buying just one milk crate would probably not be the most efficient for money. And so I tried looking at Bunnings, Ikea and other stores that sell storage solutions hoping to find something akin to a milk crate. Strangely enough, nobody sells anything like it. Weird! 

I stumbled upon a reddit post asking about where to get milk crates, and most people said they just somehow have it; possibly misplaced, borrowed and never returned, or.. they stole it. There's a lot of posts like this asking where to get it, and most people advise to just steal them.[^1] Companies that deliver goods and fresh produce will usually use milk crates for ease in delivery, and you're supposed to return them but it doesn't seem like the workers really care enough to keep track because apparently 7/11 and ColesWorth will usually have a bunch lying around. 

Reddit recommends to either ask an employee (I'm too scared to do this) or just straight up go to the loading bay/back of the store and yoink some (I'm also too scared to do this). Like it's kind of hard to get away with yoinking a milkcrate unless you have like a car or something, it seems awfully suspicious to be holding a milk crate and I'm not sure how I'd answer a question like "Why do you have a milk crate", lol. 

Anyways, it was my plan to leave it for another day and just wait for a milk crate to randomly appear at the front of my door and go from there. It wasn't a priority anyways, and ain't not way I'm paying $25+ for a single milk crate. 

And so I digress into my day; I went exploring in the city today, a mental health day if you will. Letting go of the milk crate yoinking expedition, my goal today was to eat really good fish and chips, maybe somewhere near sea water. Consulting friends and Google Maps, it seemed like this little shop was perfect, [Kirribilli Seafoods](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bh94y1jUFcmXuCu66), the plan was to buy some fish and chips and sit by the harbour and enjoy the view and some nice, oily fish and chips. And so I travelled by train, only to arrive at Town Hall and to be greeted with track work and no easy way to get across the Harbour bridge without driving. My thought process here is, it will probably take some time to get there by bus, and I kind of want to go to the arcade and do some window shopping afterwards so I would have to return, so may as well just stay in this general area. And so I just found some fish and chips on this side of the bridge, which sadly enough there is not much options. I picked [HAYMARKET FISH AND CHIPS](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TYZEizhfqqYoE2Pd6) because it has good reviews and it's close by. 

<u>Quick review:</u>
The guy looked like he hated his job, took him like 10~ minutes to serve me because he was prepping other people's orders (he was the only one working) and service was not with a smile :(, made me feel bad for even ordering at his joint lol, I feel that when you own a business like this you should be happy serving customers and making people happy with your food.  
I thought about it for a bit, food business owners either do it because they love sharing their food and/or like making bonds and friendships with people, food is a universal language afterall. This man looked relatively old (possibly English background, or potentially Spanish/Portuguese? He kind of had an accent but he was also really quiet so I can't be sure) so he's probably been doing this for a while, and with the changing in landscape of Chinatown and gentrification, I feel like most people who go to Paddy's Market are tourists and people he will never see again, and I know that sounds kind of miserable. You're just a casual fish and chips shop serving basic food, it gives you more opportunity to strike conversation. He definitely did not want to talk to anyone. 
How was the food? This has to be like top tier fish and chips no doubt, the chips had such a perfect crisp shell and soft inside, possibly double fried coated in the perfect amount of chicken salt, and not too hot either. Pretty sure he used tartare sauce from the fish market because it tasted exactly the same that I bought from there. Fish was good, tasty batter and fish. I don't really know much about what makes a fish good, I think my review was more on the chips than anything LOL but I dig it regardless. Come here for the perfectly fried chips, I'm willing to look past the service because I only came there for the food. 

Anyways, I continue walking around, looking for people to shoot and things to do. I randomly stumble upon an mini artist convention at Town Hall called [MoMo Art Mart](https://www.momoartmart.com), $10 entry. I decide to check it out because, 1. I really want to replace some of the artwork at my place (my brother's stuff is still hung up) and 2. I've never been inside this building so it's the perfect opportunity to check it out. I wait 30 minutes, get in, walk around, chat to some fella about my camera and learned there's a huge photography event the next day in the city as well (wish I could go but I'm busy), buy a cute A5 artwork, and while I was looking around, someone caught my attention and waved. The person was from a stall I had zero interest in so I thought they were just trying to sell me something so I waved back and walked away awkwardly... I had to do a re-take of the situation a minute later because.. well the person seemed awfully familiar. I was already on the way out by that point and it was too late to double check. I think it was a mate's old sister but I couldn't confirm. Later on I saw an Instagram post by her and it was actually her lol. I think I didn't believe it initially because this was some random event that I stumbled upon that I didn't think anyone I knew would be here, let alone someone who I hadn't seen in YEARS, who I didn't think even made art still, let alone sell it! I have since messaged them about this and wished them well.

Anyways, this is the artwork I bought

And here's my wall.

I wish I knew the artists. I plan on replacing everything on the right side. 

Continuing on, I was on the way home and a mate asked if I wanted to join him at Wetherill Park to check out some cars. There was some kind of car event, [Cars Under the Stars](https://fb.me/e/2gWWLhYhU). I had nothing else to do and I've never checked out a car event before, so I tagged along. We saw some cool cars, lots of reving, testosterone and middle eastern kids and adults wearing black hoodies, joggers and TNs/Jordans/NMDs (surprising amount). And there it was...

The milk crate.

A lonely milk crate hanging outside of a store, possibly used for smokos or premeditated bludging. It's like fate was telling me this is the moment. I did not expect to find one today so I was a little hesitant.. but the rest is history. I know it was terrible that I knicked it, but like.. yeah there's no excusing it lol. I walked out of the carpark randomly carrying a milk crate. I acted like I was meant to be doing this, hidden in plain sight, there was no stopping me. I know what I did was wrong, and there's no way I'll ever repay what I did, so I will cherish this milk crate for the rest of my life. Thank you, random business owner! :)

I think in hindsight I should have just checked Facebook Marketplace or GumTree, as it looks like there are plenty of options here. But it's too late now, the damage is done. Maybe one day I'll return this milk crate to the rightful owner.. one day! RemindMe! 5 years
