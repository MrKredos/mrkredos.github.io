Been a while. Initially when I made this website, I thought I would use it to share my thoughts, but I've been doing that on my diary and my google docs, so I just never ended up using this at all (and I'm too lazy). Well, I need to start updating it so I can show off my cool side projects, so may as well add a fun little update to go along with it! 

## Quick Update:
- Moved back home
- Got a new job, but only temporarily
    - Company is sinking ship, losing too much money, budget cuts, less shifts, etc, etc. 
- Winter sucks, this house has terrible insulation
    - Too debilitating to do anything, to be honest! 
- Worked on a few new projects 
    - Doing the usual OMEGA tournamnets
        - Bi-yearly fighting game tournaments
    - Trouble in Parradise; TEKKEN 8 locals
        - Stream assets
    - DICE; WSU student club collab, Mario Kart World
        - Stream assets
- Getting back into photography again [^1] 
- Went to Japan
    - Went to EVO for TEKKEN 8, went 1-2. 
    - Bought a cool Goomba hat from USJ, I think I will cherish this forever
    - Didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped for, I think I need to do a solo trip next time. 
    - Gained a nasty spending habit, eating habit and smoking habit... still recovering. 
- Looking for a new job (hence why I am updating this page)
