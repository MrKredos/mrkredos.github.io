I'm getting that feeling of being down again, and usually this is when I write best (terrible habit I think), because there's a lot bubbling up to the surface of my mind and I'm constantly thinking about this one thing, and writing it just helps me escape that thought loop (a common theme with me) and currently it's always the same question; what do I actually want to do with my life and what steps am I making towards it? 

I think I want to make games, I think I want to be creative in some sort of way, I want to live a fullfilling life without regrets. 

- Games? Well, before I want to make games I need to be good at this and that, and I haven't even started those yet.

- Creative? Does being productive count? 

- Fullfilled? Well, I need a find a job, I need to eat more healthier, I need to exercise more, I need to be more social with the people around me, I need to finally settle down and yada yada yada. Only time will tell with this one.

Seeing all these steps backward recently (for personal reasons not gonna share), and progress seemingly going nowhere feels like everything is too hard and I just want to curl into a ball and just worry about nothing for a year. I'm very fortunate to have a support network in case all fails. 

I always look back at what I've been doing this past year and while I'm proud of all the hard work I've put in (OMEGA 3 and 4 fighting game events (add a link when its done)), it feels like I'm putting points into the wrong build, like I really want to go a software engineer build but I've been speccing in IT support, a bit of graphic design, a bit of events management. And it frustrates me, because it feels like what I say I want is not what I actually want, because I love every bit of the side quests, but I know deep down software dev is actually what I want to do. It's like I'm just avoiding the inevitable, running away from my problems. Even right now, I'm just avoiding my problems by writing this out, when I could be grinding leetcode BS, or actually making the website look nice lol. I'm afraid to take that big leap because it's not comfortable. But it's ironic because I'm running away from this to be running into something argueably more difficult and more rewarding, hence why I don't understand what is wrong with me.

Ah well, time to put my foot down and start actually getting my stuff together.
