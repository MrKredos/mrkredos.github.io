Merry Christmas! 

I'm not particularly fond of catching up with extended family during Chistmas, not that I hate them or anything but it's that whole song and dance of catching up and getting asked what you're up to and not really having anything that interesting to share. Same old me, just another year older... It's exhausting having to bring something to the table and having a lot of expectations dangled above your head, and I don't particularly like socialising either. Well anyways, we do the yearly conversations, eat some nice food and open presents, but this time I joined in for some boardgames which seems to be a yearly staple that I always somehow miss (sometimes intentionally or coincidentally). 

Today was the day I learned more about the enjoyment of boardgames. We played too many that night; 
- Mahjong
    - Classic Mahjong action. I think we played Chinese Mahjong maybe a little more on the casual side since some of us didn't know how to play. 
- [Machi Koro](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143884/machi-koro)
    - Pretty fun game, first time trying it out. 
- [Azul](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul)
    - Too much fun
- [Carcassonne](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne) 
- Some other random card games
    - [Exploding Kittens](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172225/exploding-kittens) 
    - Matching Princess game? It was a kids game

We played for a few hours after big lunch and I dominated in every game; heh *dusts shoulder*. *pans to opponents* ... *it's children no older than 10*. My auntie took these pretty seriously and is really competitive and may have taken offense to my pure gaming skill. She actually vowed to beat me the next time we meet lol. 

Honestly tho, it really made me appreciate boardgames a lot more. I might decide to make my own board game at one point in my life. It seems like a fun little challenge! There are 3 categories I'll slot these games into.

- Social
    - Where the fun comes from interactions from others, 
    - Games like [Cards against humanity](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/50381/cards-against-humanity). 
- RNG manipulation
    - Fun comes from the systems and interacting with the game. 
    - Games like Azul or Mahjong fit here, where you're more fighting the board game than the other player (most of the time). 
- Bit of both (long term decision making)
    - Maybe a good mix of both social tactics and RNG manipulation, where there is equal weight in how you interact with the game and the people you're playing with. 
    - Like [Catan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan), or Carcassonne.  

I'm no expert though, so take any of this with a grain of salt if you wish. But I'm a huge fan of games like Catan where decisions can create tension between opponents and there is a real sense of rivalry. But that will probably take years for me to make.

I suppose by writing any of this down it keeps me accountable and it means I'll have something to refer back to in the future when I eventually do make something!
