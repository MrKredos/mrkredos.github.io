Isn't it crazy how your perspective can change your just with a tiny bit of information?

A bit of context, I have quite a few siblings and I've always found it suffocating. You're always around them, impossible to stand out and be your own person, you're always constantly fighting for your parents attention, doing things to impress them, always jealous when attention is not given to you, not being able to just be you because that can run the risk of not getting attention and your always at war and theres never enough time to do what makes you, you. Not only that, but I lived in a small house, it was cramped and we all had to share bedrooms so privacy doesn't exist. I was one of the older ones and we were essentially baby sitters/caregivers for our younger siblings even though we were only a few years older. You know, when I was younger I gave a lot of thought to teaching kids and making sure they didn't turn out like bad people. I was extremely self aware and I spent a lot of time trying to be a helpful son by learning how to raise my siblings the right way; how my actions affected them as they grew up and how/if the same actions would affect the next siblings. I had so many different chances to learn about how children grow up, and it's crazy because a lot of what I learned help me understand how I learn things and how interact with the world. I guess it gave me perspective on learning and how people learn. But sorry I digress, seems like needless rambling but my point was I've always resented my childhood, I feel like I grew up too fast.

I've always envied only-child kids because they usually don't have to work for love and attention from your parents, it's kind of a guarantee. I always attributed my failures to my living conditions, stuff I could not change; 
- Not enough love and care in my early years
    - Always felt isolated and me doing nothing only made it worse
- No privacy -> no way to self reflect -> difficulty in improving self
    - Silence was a luxury in my household, and I could never meditate and self reflect which makes it hard to just think when I want to
    - Basically, just not enough time for myself.
- No presence of dad
    - Dad slept during the day and worked at night so we never really got to see him outside of weekends, and even then he would have a wack sleep pattern.
        - I would look up to my mum as the sole role model and she would always be stressing about raising us, and 
    - I think this just affected how I should be approaching life
- Anxiety
    - I think this was the culimation of everything said previously.

All I ever think/thought about was the negatives of my childhood.

A mate of mine, great conversationalist, curious mind and tries to be non-biased, had a conversation about my childhood. 
I think he's an only child, he mentioned it must be so great to have a lot of siblings, it must be a lot of fun to have so many people around. And I just snapped at him, "bro it absolutely isn't" and told him it's just suffocating to put things simply. I think he was genuinely taken back by how strongly I thought about this, and his reaction made me think and then it dawned on me... **Not everyone has siblings**, it was a crazy epiphany. I bet it's lonely to be an only child, you only get to play with other people at school or when your parents bring you places, it can be just as suffocating when you are the only child and all the expectations are put on you. I guess the upside is you get more time things you want to do, but you might just fall into the trap of doing what your parents want you to do. He explained his point of view and I explained mine and I guess we both just came to realisation, as if both of us always wanted what the other had. It was strangely cathartic. 

I feel a bit more grateful about my experiences looking back, instead of looking back in resent. Sometimes all it takes is someone to actually listen to what you have to say. It's rare nowadays, I must say!
