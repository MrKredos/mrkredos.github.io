## Today, I: 
- Had an interview for an IT support role, and I think I did good
    - Apparently I was the only one that finished all the technical questions, so I've got high hopes
- Wasted time pondering and possibly squandering on a previous job offer
- Ate too much food (again) 
- Watched Gone Girl by David Fincher[^1]
- Wrote this journal entry
- And on top of all of that, today I feel lost. 

I'm always like this when I'm at a crossroads. Right now I'm inbetween jobs; I'm unsure where the future will take me, where the world feels like my oyster. All I've been doing is applying for new jobs, worrying about how I'm going to pay the bills, worried about if what I do is fullfilling enough.. I feel like I just want too much in life but never enough time or energy to do it. 

What is this about anyways? 

After watching Gone Girl[^1], it brought back this feeling in me, the feeling of being inspired, of being blown away by something so fascinating and engaging and sincere and intense and captivating- that makes me want to do the same, something that I feel like I want to do for other people... To inspire. It made me ask myself the question.. what inspires me? What do I live for, what am I supposed to be doing, I'm given so many opportunities for what reason, what purpose do I serve in the grand scheme of things, what value have I been giving to the world and am I doing it right..? I feel like today is a great example of who I am. 

I'm chasing a job that sounds like something I'd like to do but it's gamble whether or not I will get it (and even if I do get it, they said it might only be part time, and I need full time) when I already have a good job offer, something that is guaranteed and stable and will pay the bills, albeit not what I'm after. On top of that I splurged, spent my money on a KFC Zinger Crunch box that didn't even taste good and cost way too much, bought a cigarette pack that I know I shouldn't be buying, cooked up more food at home (a beef/onion stir fry with 2 packs of migoreng) and watched a 2.5 hour long movie instead of doing what I feel like I should be doing, cleaning the house, exercising, doing my bloody assignment due on Friday. 

I always used to believe that I was going to become useless when I grow up; I get bad grades, I don't try hard enough in anything, I'm a liability money wise and emotionally, I complain about everything and hate doing chores, and to top it all off I'm spoiled, immature and oblivious. 

To avoid this situation, I begun to figure out ways to use my time wisely and to future proof myself. Over time, I taught myself that my only worth is by giving my time and effort to people who actually need it, and this has been the core of my beliefs for a huge chunk of my life. People who are lonely, I'll give you my time of day because it's what I believe is right, you're struggling with your problems, I'll be a lending ear until you feel like you're good enough to pick yourself up, oh you need money for bills? I'm happy to give you as much as you need until you're up on your feet again. Over time, I learnt that giving a part of yourself to everyone you meet, no matter how much they need it, is unhealthy mentally. I always thought time and effort was an unlimited resource, and it can be if you're up for the task, but you lose out on your own self development. All those precious years wasted on other people. I was happy to help everyone around me in a heart beat, but nobody else was willing to put in the same effort for me. And it hit me then, nobody actually cares about you.. nobody actually wants to help you.. the people who use you just want to use you to make themselves feel better, they want to increase their social stats, to gain connections from you, to take your happiness away from you so they can spend it on themselves, without a single thought into giving it back. I always believed in paying it forward, but I feel like I'm giving more than I can handle. It's sad to look back on, because I'm sure there were people around me that were willing to be leg for support or to lend an ear, but I was too oblivious and close minded to look around for help.  

I don't think that part of me is lost. Young naive me thought I could help everyone with any of their problems, but you've just got to look at it another way; I can only help people with problems that I'm familiar with, and with what resources I can work with. The scale and scope has been reduced, but at my core I still love to help people. 

Gone Girl blew me away and inspired me to get my creative hat back on, and it reminded me of the younger me who just wanted to create. I want to be able to create something that will make someone else inspired to do the same, that is the ultimate goal. Funnily enough, I don't think I'm ready for that task, so right now is just me building myself back up, from all of the years of neglect of my mental and physical.
