I spent the whole day just recovering what felt like food poisoning, I cooked 3 day old pork from the fridge and it had been smelling strange, figured once cooked it would be fine, but I had a terrible migrane and it all went away once I pooped some food out (apologies for too much information), it was really stringy and orange/yellowish for some reason. I had cooked sinigang for the first time in a while and a mango float, both tailor made for a little old friend who needed it, myself, hence why it could only be the pork. I even skipped work on a chat shift, one of the more easier shifts because I felt genuinely unwell (normally I just skip work because I'm too ceebs). Most of the day I spent playing this game [As Dusk Falls](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1341820/), got to the last chapter and decided to leave it for now because I spent like 5+ hours and felt like I was driving myself insane. I wouldn't normally do this, but since I got the Game Pass, I'm kind of obliged to finish it at least (I know, I'm shooting myself in the foot here). But sorry, I digress from my main point. 

I need a mental reset, kinda losing the sauce here. Losing what matters the most to me, what drives me, what I feel like I should be doing and what I want to do, everything important is being blended into a mush and being processed like it was a thought never meant to be cared about or given any thought. So I decided to go for a small walk, something I used to do daily when I moved here. It's 10:20pm~, lovely lukewarm yet windy weather, enough to not need a jacket and enough for inside clothes. Same routine as always when stepping out of my apartment and into the mini courtyard; put in my earbuds, feel the fresh air on my skin and in my lungs, turn on a podcast, audiobook or video essay and just walk. For the most part, I don't even know what I'm listening to half the time and it is just white noise (I hate my habit of passive listening), and eventually after getting too far in Life the Universe and Everything (Hitch Hikers Book 3) without paying attention I decided to just pause it, and walked towards the park that is right across the normally busy road, but very quiet at this time of night. 

Once I had left the road side and walked past the bushes and trees that seperate the park and the road, was a beautiful site to behold. Being able to see 180 degrees of the sky just looking up is one of my bucket list items, to enjoy nature's canvas without the busy-ness and intrusion of mankind, and to forget such a site is right outside my front door? While it isn't quite 180 degrees, it felt like it and gave me a taste wanting more. The shimmering stars slightly visible behind the turtle neck pace of clouds, and the painterly strokes and dark hues of grey, grey and more grey. It's impressive how little colour yet how impressive the sky looked tonight. I thought about taking a photo, but it would never do it justice, it's not about what I saw it was about what I felt, and I felt alive. 

The amount of ideas and thoughts and observations that came through my head was kind of overwhelming yet I never turned down a single one. I could write forever but a lot of it I feel is not worth writing down but I'll give you a quick glimpse:
- Taking more photos, what do I want to do with photography
- Creating and tailoring experiences
- Friend groups and shared memories and group activities
- Ideas of organising camping trips and how to accomodate to everyone in the friend group, and how to get people to come
- Ideas on how I can get creative with backgrounds in livestreams (working on a few things for my local FGC) 
- Pets, and owning a cat, logistics and mental cost (some guy was walking their pet)
- Less interesting thoughts go here. 

Anyways, maybe it's a good idea I don't do these walks all the time, they invoke so much creative energy, but I feel like it was all released at once and needs to build back up again. Till the next walk, I guess!
