#### A bit of context
I do photography as a side hobby and have been taking photos ever since my dad lent me his camera that one time. I specifically love doing "street photography" (using this term lightly because I feel what I shoot isn't traditional street photography) and usually when you take photos sometimes they ask about my socials and this is just an easy way to give them my information. I don't really use instagram and I don't want to use instagram, which is everyone's most common way to give information, I'd rather stay a little anonymous about all of this. 

A bit selfish, but it gives me a reason to take photos of people without it being awkward. My thought process was shoot first and give information to ease the tension. Funny thing is, I've only ever given it once and this was in Japan haha. I think I later realised that I don't take confronting photos that let me get close to people, and I generally like to avoid those situations because I'm introverted and can't be bothered to talk to people sometimes. 

It took me a while to ever get these printed because I never felt justified to get them printed, but eventually I got them printed with Officeworks on the cheapest option they had (I think it was like $30AUD~ for 100 cards? I don't really remember to be honest, it was a while ago).

The back of the card has inspiration from some graffiti at [Macdonaldtown Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zqSDGfB2UGd8jY7g8){:target="_blank"}, you can actually see some photos of the graffiti through google maps street view of the station, for example. Usually the graffiti on this wall are stylised, but one week there was just one text that stood out and said "Get livin' or die tryin'" and it struck a chord with me. Someone out there just writing art, illegally mind you, just to share inspirational words for daily commuters to see; as opposed to the tags of their own street names just to show off their artwork or to mark their territory. A few weeks later it was painted over with a fresh coat of paint and I never did get a photo of it and it irks me to this day.

I suppose this is culture theft but I just want to share that same sentiment because it means a lot to me!
