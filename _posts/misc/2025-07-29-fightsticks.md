## Intro 
I'm a fighting game enjoyer, and what controller you use is pretty important for nothing other than aesthetics, first impressions and sharing your personaltiy and energy. Some part of me just felt it was necessary to give it a shot to understand the culture more, since everyone (well almost everyone) in the scene had one. Ever since, I've gone a little overboard and may have spent too much time on this journey to find the perfect fight stick... luckily for me, I think I did eventually find it!

# Collection
I've gone through lots of fightsticks over the years. I wish I could put them all into one photo, however they kinda floating around, got a few living at my brother's place, and some hiding in storage somewhere. I'll just list them all here however.

## [HAUTE42 T13](https://haute42.com/haute-pad-t-series/) <br>
$150AUD; second hand from a fella in the Sydney TEKKEN community

Straight up, the best controller I've ever owned and it's not even close. Ticks all of my boxes; non-expensive, good quality, artwork capabilities and buttons that don't feel cheap. It's insane how they've made such a cost efficient product feel so premium, props to the team. 

## [Waifu Sticks](https://waifusticks.square.site/product/studio-600-commission-inquiry-read-me/69?cp=true&sa=true&sbp=false&q=false) <br> 
Commissioned; ~$500AUD incl. shipping

It's a great controller, but not very portable. I treat it like an art piece more than anything. This is probably my favourite "artwork" I've curated. In quotes because I didn't draw anything, all of that is just official art. 

## [Snack Box Micro PS4 edition](https://junkfoodarcades.com/products/snack-box-micro-leverless-controller)<br> 
~$500AUD incl. shipping 
![snackbox]({{base.url}}/assets/fightsticks/snackbox.jpg)
I don't mean to smear the name of JunkFood but the quality control is not great (a lot of my friends have issues with these controllers; be it port issues, button issues),. the build itself is quite flimsy for the price (plastic housing) and not only that but I bought the PS4 version which means I can't even play PS5 games without a converter which adds like $100AUD+. I suppose that's nobody's fault but my own, but it stings. My controller works but it has some problems, some of the buttons double press or don't activate at all and probably need replacing, and this is only after a year of regular use, which I think is kind of ridiculous considering the price point.

[Hori Real Arcade Pro. Kai $200AUD](https://www.amazon.com.au/Hori-Real-Arcade-Pro-Playstation/dp/B00SULMRI4)<br> 
$150AUD second hand, from some guy in Sydney, NSW

This was my main driver for a while, however the stick would stop reading my down inputs and it gave me a reason to upgrade (since PS5s were going to be more prevalent and this is PS4 only). 

[MadCatz Tournament Edition](https://www.coleka.com/en/video-games/arcade-stick/mad-catz-arcade-fight-stick-tournament-edition-white_i1507286)<br> 
$200AUD second hand, from some guy in Merrylands, NSW

[SF4 Tournament Edition ](https://www.coleka.com/en/video-games/arcade-stick/street-fighter-iv-round-2-arcade-fight-stick-tournament-edition_i1450931) <br> 
$180AUD second hand, from some guy in Newcastle, NSW


# Process

### Artwork
It's all made in photoshop, using the templates from [FocusAttack](https://support.focusattack.com/hc/en-us/sections/28085999760155-Fightstick-Control-Panel-Templates). Really nice resources, makes my job so much easier.

A lot of the time I just come up with a silly idea, play around with some stuff and just make it and iterate on it. Other times I just find something I'm obsessed with at the time and just create something to show how much I like it (Berserk and Mob Psycho 100 fight stick art for example).

If you're looking for inspiration, just write down ideas to get the ball rolling and eventually you will find something you like. Even if you don't, some of these ideas can be reused as well. 

### Printing
You can get these printed online with cool special paper (shiny) and they cut them out for you, but if you don't have a huge budget you can get them printed yourself and cut them out yourself. 

In Australia, we have Officeworks for printing. I printed on 300gsm matte, it only costs like $1 something, and you can also buy a craft knife with a cutting board in the same store and just cut them manually. It's a bit hard to do the circles but you have room for error.
