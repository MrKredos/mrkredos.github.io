HELLO WORLD! This is my first blog (feels like cheating because I didn't do much of anything besides writing this)

For the sake of finishing off my learning for the day, I am writing down what I learned.
Today I learned how about: 
- YAML files and how front matter works
    - It's like configs and stuff
- How to run jekyll and learned more about localhosting
- Did not learn how to redirect (need to fix gnome website)
- When to use markdown and html
    - Markdown is super helpful and de-abstracts websites and content. 
- That eating a pizza by myself is miserable and makes me fat. 
- Last tutorial I watched [Themes: Jekyll - Static Site Generator; Tutorial 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoRS2D-cyko&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB&index=11)
