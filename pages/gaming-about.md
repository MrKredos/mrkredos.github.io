## Intro
I like playing games and writing my thoughts about them [(my Backloggd)](https://backloggd.com/u/patmeharder/){:target="_blank"}. 

I dabble in a lot of games, but mostly competitive multiplayer ones. 
### Fighting Games 
Started getting serious about playing fighting games around tail end of GUILTY GEAR Xrd Rev 2 (XRD), in preparation for GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- (STRIVE). I would rock up to local tournaments to test my skills at the big major tournament, Battle Arena Melbourne (and also to see international competition). I leaned towards the more casual player that has the ability to try hard when given the opportunity. I never labbed, I always just played sets. 

I took STRIVE semi seriously for like 6 months and I got 17th at BAM at the first big major for the game, a little bitter I didn't get top 16 or that I didn't get to meet any internationals (COVID and borders still pretty strict). I also went pretty poorly in XRD, but I was up against a lot of oldheads who have played the game since it released. It was a fun experience, maybe one day I'll share my experience with that because we organised a huge group and we went to GayLords (really nice Indian restaurant). 

I learned that playing fighting games this seriously and to win really sours the game for me, and to this day I still feel bitter playing that game. Or maybe the game just isn't fun lol

Currently play casually and dabble in TEKKEN 8 and Street Fighter 6, and just whatever is popular at the time, mainly going to locals. 

I help run tournaments and locals; see [projects]({{base.url}}/projects/)

#### My History with FGS: 
Was always interested in the scene, used to watch touranment videos for SF4 and Marvel vs. Capcom 3. I used to love trying to understand what the hell was going on. 
- Played a few fighting games when I was younger
    - Street Fighter 2 Turbo
    - Super Smash Bros. Brawl
    - SF4 for mobile (lol)
    - Friends who had fighting games

### Rhythm Games 
- Currently retired due to life getting busy, but will always play a few sets every now and then. 
- Acheivements: 
    - inf dan in Sound Voltex (2020 iirc?)
    - 8th dan IIDX (2021?)
        - I skipped SAFARI lol 
    - Passed a 17 in DDR
        - [„Å≥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2R0HpBNkzQ) (The chart isn't hard, it's just stamina. I doubt I could do this today) 

#### My History with RGS 
Used to play a lot of guitar hero, Rhythm Heaven for DS and eventually osu!. I was so fascinated by all the videos of people playing DDR and stuff and had always wanted to try them. I eventually when I got old enough to afford going to arcade and it started with DDR (since it was effectively the only rhythm game we had in Sydney at the time), then PuriKura brought over SDVX and IIDX, and slowly all the rhythm game started to come and that's when I started falling out of the scene. 

### Tactical Shooters
- Casual CS2 and Valorant hater (I still played it)
    - Games with VC are really funny sometimes

I wish I could be good at these games, but I think the ship has sailed for learning this game with friends. 

### Hero Shooters 
- Marvel Rivals 
    - Got Grandmasters, and my team got top 256 in MRC (I didn't play a single game lol)
- Overwatch 2 (and 1 when it came out)

### MOBAS
- League and DOTA 2 when I was yougner
    - Everyone goes through this phase
- Waiting for Deadlock to come out
- Battlerite 
    - I miss this game :[

### Other 
The occational indie game that I see chiblee or Northerlion playing.
