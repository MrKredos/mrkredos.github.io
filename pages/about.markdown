A Computer Science Graduate and aspiring game developer who sucks at coding, doesn't make games.

I like playing games and writing my thoughts about [them](https://backloggd.com/u/patmeharder/). I dabble in rhythm games, fighting games, tactical shooters, hero shooters and the occational indie game that I see chiblee or Northerlion playing. 

I like watching movies and writing my thoughts about [them](https://letterboxd.com/MrKredos/) 

I had a phase where I ran some student clubs in university, I wanted to put my energy into something and I think I created something pretty cool and made some life long friends from it. 

I think I've put most effort into creating a scoreboarding dock for OBS Studio, allowing you to edit scores, names and what not without having to directly edit the scene. 

Currently looking for work in IT or Software Development, whatever comes first, whichever is nicer. 

At some point I'll start adding some stuff, but that will come later.
