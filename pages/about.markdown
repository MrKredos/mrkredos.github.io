A Computer Science Graduate and aspiring game developer who sucks at coding, doesn't make games.

Check out my [projects]({{base.url}}/projects/) for some of my work.<br>

I had a phase where I ran some student clubs in university (Anime club, Esports club and more recently the Fighting Game Club (not real fighting)), I wanted to put my energy into something and I think I created something pretty cool and made some life long friends from it. 

Currently looking for work in IT or Software Development, whatever comes first, whichever is nicer. 

At some point I'll start adding some stuff to this page, slowly but surely.
