A Computer Science Graduate and aspiring game developer who sucks at coding, doesn't make games.

Check out my [projects]({{base.url}}/projects/) for some of my work.<br>
I had a phase where I ran some student clubs in university, I wanted to put my energy into something and I think I created something pretty cool and made some life long friends from it. 

I like watching movies and writing my thoughts about them [(my letterboxd)](https://letterboxd.com/MrKredos/).

Currently looking for work in IT or Software Development, whatever comes first, whichever is nicer. 

At some point I'll start adding some stuff, but that will come later.
