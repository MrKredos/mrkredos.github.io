Here is my work on the first OMEGA tournaments. First time trying to do something like this, had a lot of fun figuring everything out. This was the only one where I put more than enough effort just to get things working, just because it was a way to show off I suppose.

### Fonts used
[Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue), the holy grail of fonts. Versatile, clean, free and most importantly monospaced, meaning it's easy to code with and figure out width for elements on the page. Unfortunately, it is overused and I tend to try to avoid it for that reason. I still love using it <br>
