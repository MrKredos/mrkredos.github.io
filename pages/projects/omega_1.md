### Intro
<ins>THEME:</ins> I actually have no clue where the idea came from. I was not part of the conversation for the inception of the idea, however if you're super interested I could ask for you lol

OMEGA is a fighting game tournament ran twice a year in Parramatta, NSW, organised by the Western Sydney Fighting Game Club for Western Sydney University, a student run club by a bunch of ex-students and non-students (and a few students).

<ins>My Role:</ins> My role in all of this was creating stream assets and figuring out a solution for livestreaming. 

First time trying to do something like this, had a lot of fun figuring everything out. I put more than enough effort just to get things working just because I wanted to make it look good for my team and for myself. I think I'm quite proud of how it turned out.

I took a lot of inpsiration from all of the other fighting game events in the area: 

[Kitt](https://x.com/Kitt_Miller){:target="_blank"}'s stuff
- [Floating Point](https://www.start.gg/tournament/floating-point/events){:target="_blank"} (Major) 
- [The Epping Arcadian](https://www.start.gg/tournament/okay-this-is-epping-arcadian-2/events){:target="_blank"} (Yearly(?))
- Theres a few more but they're roughly similar

[OzHadou](https://x.com/ozhadou){:target="_blank"}'s stuff
- [OzHadou Nationals ](https://www.start.gg/tournament/ozhadou-nationals-18/events){:target="_blank"} (Major) 
- [York Street Battles](https://www.start.gg/tournament/york-street-battles-101/details){:target="_blank"} (Monthlies)

I don't know these people personally, but they run a pretty cool show tech wise. If you're reading this, thanks for the inspiration! 

# Showcase
<video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
<source src="{{base.url}}/assets/omega/showcase.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
Quick video showcasing how everything works. 

# [StreamControl](https://farpnut.net/streamcontrol/){:target="_blank"}
Software used for updating scores and stuff. It is pretty old technology. FYI, I did not make this, props to farpnut for the awesome implementation. 

How it works: 
1. Software takes input, saves to file.
2. Add text in OBS that reads from file.
3. Voila!

# Background

<video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
<source src="{{base.url}}/assets/omega/background.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
Made in AfterEffects, just put the image and put WaveWorld, and then adjusted some numbers to get it working. I just followed a guide about WaveWorld and just created something out of it. First time ever touching AfterEffects.

I learned a lot trying to get this background to work, and it has a lot of growing pains attached to it. It's not very clean, left hand side kinda warps a bit strangely and it doesn't actually fully loop, and you can see so on the right hand side with the little stutter. 

# Assets

Good friend [Leo](https://x.com/lonkdoodle){:target="_blank"} created all of the art assets. Amazing artist and one of the tournament organisers. I'm more of a curator who takes an idea and runs away with it. 

### Fonts used
[Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue){:target="_blank"}, the holy grail of fonts. Versatile, clean, free and most importantly monospaced, meaning it's easy to code with and figure out width for elements on the page. Unfortunately, it is overused and I tend to try to avoid it for that reason. I still love using it <br>
[Jetlab Medium](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/jetlab-variable){:target="_blank"}, free font for perosnal and commercial, I think as long as you have the Adobe Liscence? You might not even need it, but I'm not sure. I
